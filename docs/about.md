<div class="section-title">Background</div>

I'm a platform engineer and architect specializing in building reliable, governed delivery systems for enterprise organizations. Over the past 8 years, I've led modernization initiatives, designed secure infrastructure practices, and built teams that operate complex distributed systems.

**Early Career** (2016–2019)  
Started as a systems administrator managing on-premise infrastructure, then transitioned to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure). Learned the hard way that scripts don't scale, that documentation matters, and that downtime is expensive.

**Platform Engineering** (2019–Present)  
Moved into platform engineering to solve the scaling problem: how do you enable 100+ teams to deploy safely and independently? This led to:
- Kubernetes and container orchestration
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- GitOps and CI/CD automation
- Security and compliance frameworks
- Operating models for internal developer platforms

**Philosophy**

I believe in:

**Governance as a feature, not a burden.** Policies should enable teams, not block them. The best guardrails are those that don't feel like guardrails.

**Documented decisions over tribal knowledge.** Architecture decisions, runbooks, and operational procedures should be written down and version-controlled. This scales teams and reduces on-call fatigue.

**Repeatability over manual work.** Upgrades, deployments, and disaster recovery should be automated, tested, and practiced regularly. If you can't do it twice, you can't do it in production.

**Observable systems over alerting noise.** Alerting should be sparse and meaningful. The platform should expose enough signals that operators and developers can understand failure modes.

**Team first frameworks.** Tools and platforms exist to serve teams. The best technology is the one your team can understand and operate confidently.

<div class="section-title">What I'm Interested In</div>

**Right now:**
- Supply chain security (attestation, provenance, SLSA)
- Cost optimization in multi-cloud environments
- Observability and reliability at scale
- Team scaling and organizational design for platform teams

**Long-term:**
- Building platforms that enable autonomy, not control
- Reducing operational toil through better abstractions
- Open-source contributions to Kubernetes and CI/CD ecosystems
